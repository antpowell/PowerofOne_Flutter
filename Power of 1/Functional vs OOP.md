# Programming Paradigms
## Functional vs OOP
### Functional
#### General Description
#### Axioms
- Outputs should only depend on inputs.
- Functions are first-class citizens
	- can be assigned to variables
	- passed as arguments
	- returned from other functions
- Pure functions
	- A pure function is one that relies only on its inputs to generate its result. And given the same input, it will always produce the same result. Besides, it produces no side effects (any change outside the function's environment).
- Data is stateless
	- once created data should not mutate
	- data should not be changed directly it should be overwritten with the new data
